# Image Processing Basics
We will learn the very basic image processing functions using OpenCV in Python, as a first step. In next lab. sessions we will see how to use it in our ROS nodes.

We will be using Google Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com
https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html

Google Colab offers an environment with a Jupyter notebook preinstalled, as well as some libraries, like OpenCV.

https://jupyter.org

The videos explaining the execution of the different notebooks can be accessed through the online classroom system https://aulavirtual.upo.es

## Intro to OpenCV and basic binary operations

Open and work with the notebook [IntroOpenCV.ipynb](https://github.com/robotics-upo/rva-course-material/blob/master/imageprocessingbasics/IntroOpenCV.ipynb)

The objective is to implement a simple green chroma key to overlay a second image.


## Linear filtering in OpenCV

Open, play and understand the notebook [filtering.iypnb](https://github.com/robotics-upo/rva-course-material/blob/master/imageprocessingbasics/filtering.ipynb)

## Template matching in OpenCV

Open, play and understand the notebook [tempatematching.iypnb](https://github.com/robotics-upo/rva-course-material/blob/master/imageprocessingbasics/templatematching.ipynb)
