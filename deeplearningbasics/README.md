# Deep Learning Basics
In this case, we will learn how to implement and train a simple CNN for image classification, and to use a trained network within our OpenCV code

We will be using Google Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com

https://medium.com/tensorflow/colab-an-easy-way-to-learn-and-use-tensorflow-d74d1686e309

Google Colab offers an environment with a Jupyter notebook preinstalled, as well as TensorFlow
